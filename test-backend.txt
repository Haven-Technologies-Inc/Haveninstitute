Excellent! All containers are now starting up. Let's test if the backend is responding.

Test the backend health:
ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www/Haveninstitute && curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health"

If that works, also test the external access:
ssh root@5.78.147.82 "curl http://localhost:80"

And check the final container status:
ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www/Haveninstitute && docker compose ps"
