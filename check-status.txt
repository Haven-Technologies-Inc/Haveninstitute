Great! The Docker rebuild was successful. Now let's check if the services are running properly.

Run this command to check the current status:

ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www/Haveninstitute && docker compose ps"

Then test the backend health again:

ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www/Haveninstitute && curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health"

If the health check still fails, check the backend logs:

ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www/Haveninstitute && docker compose logs backend"
