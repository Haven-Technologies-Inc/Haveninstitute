Perfect! Server is cleaned. Now let's deploy fresh:

1. Clone fresh repository:
ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www && git clone https://github.com/Haven-Technologies-Inc/Haveninstitute.git"

2. Go to project directory:
ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www/Haveninstitute"

3. Deploy fresh with all fixes:
ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www/Haveninstitute && docker compose up -d --build"

4. Wait for services to start (about 2 minutes):
ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www/Haveninstitute && sleep 120 && docker compose ps"

5. Test backend health:
ssh root@5.78.147.82 "cd /var/www/Haveninstitute && curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health"

This should give us a completely fresh deployment with all our fixes!
